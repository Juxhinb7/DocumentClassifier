The Norwegian striker is having a magnificent season with Manchester City

Erling Haaland has started the season with Manchester City scoring 17 goals and providing three assists in 11 games.

The Norwegian, in his last game, scored three goals and provided two assists against Manchester United.

His numbers are amazing, as he is on course to smash all possible goalscoring records in the Premier League.

In just two months, in addition to scoring 14 goals in 8 games, Haaland has also scored three hat-tricks in a row at home.

In doing so, he became the fastest to score such hat-tricks in the history of the Premier League by doing it in just 8 games, 40 less than Michael Owen.

After the match, the media wanted to know Pep Guardiola's opinion about his forward and asked him to compare the Norwegian with Leo Messi.

Guardiola answered bluntly when asked if he had the same feeling with Erling as he had at Barcelona with Messi.

"The difference is that maybe Erling needs all his teammates, while Messi had the ability to do it on his own," Guardiola confirmed in his post-match press conference.

Haaland is the outright top scorer in the Premier League, closely followed by Kane who has seven goals. Foden is the second top scorer for Guardiola's side with five.
