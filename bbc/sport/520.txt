The 37-year-old is looking to get more out of Anthony Davis

The Los Angeles Lakers are looking to change some things ahead of the new NBA season.

Coach Darvin Ham will be tasked with making the necessary adjustments on and off the court, but LeBron James has reportedly lent a hand with Anthony Davis.

Davis was injured for much of last season and that affected the team's performance, as they failed to qualify for the postseason.

Now that he's back, the Lakers are hoping for a different story.

At 37 years old, LeBron understands that his physical condition isn't the same and that's why he expects more from Davis, who he believes needs to step up.

Davis spoke to Yahoo Sports and revealed what James asked of him in the offseason.

LeBron had a conversation with coach Ham and told him that it's time for a leadership change on the Lakers.

The four-time NBA champion is said to have told the coach that Davis must replace his role and that the whole team will follow his lead.

Davis didn't hesitate in accepting the challenge.

"I'm excited about this challenge and what's ahead," he said.

"I think we have a great group of guys to get the job done. Now it's all about getting down to work.

"All I can do is lead with my actions".

The Lakers' No.3 already proved in the 2020 postseason that he can fill that role.

Although James was named Finals MVP, many felt Davis was the one who should take that distinction because of what he did against the Miami Heat.
