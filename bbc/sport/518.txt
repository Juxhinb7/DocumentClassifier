The NBA regular season is getting closer and closer and Russell Westbrook's future at the LA Lakers is still uncertain.

With teams returning to practice and preseason games, the Lakers player has had "moments of peace".

However, a new report from 'The Athletic' puts the player back in the media spotlight.

As reported by Shams Charania, Sam Amick, and Jovan Buha, there was a meeting between Rob Pelinka, Jeanie Buss, and Kurt Rambis to discuss Westbrook's situation.

In the talks, the three considered sending the player to the Indiana Pacers, along with two future first-rounders in the NBA Draft.

In return, the Lakers wanted Myles Turner and Buddy Hield. Management also consulted with coach Darvin Ham and executives Joey and Jesse Buss.

All three also felt that was the best option for Westbrook and the team.

However, there was no final decision, as they did not reach a consensus.

According to the information from the Athletic, Jeanie Buss, owner of the team, was the one who defended Westbrook the most.

For Buss, the mix between Ham's style and the plan on the court could be the perfect combination to get the most out of the player, who was far from his best last season.

At the Lakers' Media Day last week, Ham expressed his happiness in coaching Westbrook and viewed him as a key part of the team heading into the season.

Even LeBron James himself said he was excited to play alongside Russell again.

The Pacers are still interested in a trade, but they won't wait forever. With the regular season approaching, the Indiana team won't sit idly by.

If both parties want to reach an agreement, everything indicates that the change must be made before the action begins, because if it is done later, it could affect the dynamics of the two teams.
