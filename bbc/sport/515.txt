CHELSEA are set to win the race to sign Christopher Nkunku next summer, according to reports.

Nknunku was previously linked with Manchester United, but now it appears Chelsea will win the race to sign him after he undertook a medical ahead of a move next summer.

According to journalist Christian Falk, Nkunku underwent a medical check in Frankfurt earlier this month.

This was in anticipation of a transfer from RB Leipzig to Chelsea which is set to cost Â£53million.

Following a stellar campaign last season, Nkunku was voted Bundesliga Player of the Year.

And he has carried on where he left off with an impressive beginning to his season, scoring six goals in 11 games in all competitions

Nkunku previously described himself as "flattered" to be courting interest from the likes of Chelsea, Man United and Paris Saint-Germain.

Over the summer, he said: "It's no secret. There are clubs interested in me.

"Yes it's flattering, but it's also flattering to have a club like Leipzig do everything to keep me as well.

"I'll have to reflect and make a decision. The World Cup is on the way and that's another factor to take into account."

However, Nkunku signed a two-year contract extension with Leipzig in June which would keep him at the club until 2026 if it is fulfilled.

But Chelsea's interest in him may see that cut three years short.

The Blues want to overhaul their ageing central midfield with a swathe of top talents.

These include former academy prospect Declan Rice, England midfield partner Jude Bellingham and Frenchman Nkunku.
