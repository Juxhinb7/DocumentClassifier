According to Opta statistics, the Argentine is the player who is most involved in his team's attacks

After a season spent underperforming, Lionel Messi is finally showing his full worth at PSG.

He has had a dominant start to the 2022/23 season, with goals and assists, and is one of the main cornerstones of his team.

According to 'OPTA', the Argentine's numbers are above other top players like Erling Haaland and Kylian Mbappe.
Messi's usual numbers

Between club and national team, Messi has accumulated 10 goals and 8 assists. He looks more comfortable on the pitch and that is reflected not only in his numbers, but also in PSG's performance.

With the arrival of Christophe Galtier, a more team-oriented style of play has been observed, which plays to Messi's strengths.

According to 'Opta', the former Barcelona star generates a total of 5.25 dangerous situations per game.

This statistic includes goals, assists, finishes, passes and dribbles that have a direct impact on the result of their respective teams.

In this respect, he surpasses other top players in Europe.

Although Haaland is the principal star so far this season with 17 goals and three assists, his impact outside of goals is minor in Manchester City's play.

An aspect that Pep Guardiola himself has said the Norwegian needs to improve upon.

At 35 years old, Messi continues to prove that he has gas in the tank and that he can continue to amaze with his football.

Although he will not be the top scorer this season, his impact on the team performance could well be beneficial for both PSG and Argentina.
