Manchester City will meet with Bernardo Silva and his agents soon to speak about the Portugal midfielder's plans for the future.

Silva would have liked to leave for Spain in the last two summers, according to the Daily Mail, but City have not given up hope of tying him down.

City coach Pep Guardiola's posture has always been the same. The Catalan counts on Silva and considers him an important part of his team.

City want to speak with the player again, and if he doesn't change his mind and still wants to move to LaLiga, will listen to offers above €90 million.

Despite Barça's interest, especially this past summer, they never made a formal offer for Silva, who has a contract in Manchester until 2025.

Even though City want him to stay, both the club and Guardiola have said they would not stand in a player's way if he really was not happy.
