Plus: Should Chelsea's Thiago Silva have seen red against Crystal Palace?; was Aston Villa's Tyrone Mings unlucky not to get a penalty against Leeds?; and should Bournemouth's Jordan Zemura have had one too against Brentford?

Here to defend two minutes of injury-time after seven substitutions and five goals at the Etihad, plus much more - is former Premier League referee Dermot Gallagher with Ref Watch.

Although the result was already far beyond doubt, eyebrows were raised in the Manchester City ranks when only two additional minutes were signalled by the fourth official at the end of their 6-3 rout of United in the Manchester derby - after witnessing three separate substitution stoppages and five second-half goals.

Speaking on Sky Sports News as part of his weekly grilling, Dermot said: "It was unusual to have two minutes added on at the end of the Manchester derby. We've had three or four minutes added on in first halves, five and six in second halves.

"There's much more time added on than ever before, but the Manchester derby was very unusual."
