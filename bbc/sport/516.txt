FOOTBALL fans have mocked the height difference between Erling Haaland and Lisandro Martinez ahead of the Manchester derby this weekend.

Champions Man City host local rivals Man Utd at the Etihad on Sunday afternoon in both sides' first match back from the international break.

Haaland has made an incredible start to life in England, scoring 14 goals in his opening 10 matches for Pep Guardiola's men.

Meanwhile, Martinez suffered a traumatic first two games in the Premier League as Man Utd were beaten 2-1 by Brighton and then thumped 4-0 away at Brentford.

Since then, four wins in a row - including victories over Liverpool and Arsenal - have coincided with some thoroughly impressive performances from Martinez - who arrived from Ajax for Â£55million in the summer.

But that upturn in form has not stopped football supporters from pointing out the huge size difference between Haaland and the Argentine defender.

Haaland stands at a gigantic 6ft 4in, while diminutive centre-back Martinez is just 5ft 9in.

And that seven-inch advantage the Man City striker is set to have over the South American defender is something social media has gone crazy over.

One said: "Imagine Martinez marking Haaland during a corner kick. Itâ€™s even a disrespect to Haaland ðŸ˜­."

Another added: "Look at Haaland then look at Martinez and Malacia height. Can't you see the score line is already 3-0 in favour of Manchester City?"

A third posted a photo of a man looking over a sea of people from the top of a building and said: "Erling Haaland looking at Man Utd fans who think Lisandro Martinez will stop him from scoring."

And a fourth depicted Haaland as Daemon Targaryen from House of Dragon, before labelling Martinez Tyrion Lannister from Game of Thrones.

City head into the Manchester derby one point off league leaders Arsenal.

United can move to within two points of their local rivals with a win at the Etihad - where they have won three of the last four meetings.
