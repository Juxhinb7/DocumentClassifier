The Internet is obsessed with him. His playful smile. His big, soulful eyes. The fact that he has no bad angle in photos.

His owner is also actor Chris Evans, which makes the pair's selfies ten times more "like"-able on Instagram.

Named after a character from the movie "Oliver & Company," Dodger is a boxer-mix that the Marvel star adopted in 2015.

One half of a "pair of dysfunctional codependents," Dodger has at least as many admirers as his famous owner, who this week announced a partnership with dog food company Jinx in a move that's as on-brand for Evans, one of Hollywood's most prolific dog dads, as one could get.

In a conversation with CNN, Evans talks about how Dodger inspired his new business venture, which will have him playing "an active role in the business and creative direction of the brand," according to a press release, and the humbling pleasures of pet parenting.
