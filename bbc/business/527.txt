 There was good news and bad in Friday’s revised data about the UK economy. It grew — marginally — in the second quarter of the year, rather than shrinking as previously estimated.

But the latest update from the Office for National Statistics also showed that the United Kingdom is the only G7 economy that has not recovered fully from the pandemic, with GDP still 0.2% smaller than at the start of 2020. And, according to the Bank of England, the economy is most likely already shrinking again, with inflation heading to 11%.

“The important thing [in Friday’s data] was that the UK is struggling to grow and facing a probable deeper recession down the road, and today’s revision doesn’t change that,” said Craig Erlam, senior market analyst at Oanda.

  It may be a long time before it does recover, given the crisis unleashed by Prime Minister Liz Truss’ decision last week to unveil huge unfunded tax cuts alongside a massive package of energy subsidies. That gamble spooked financial markets and sent borrowing costs for the government, businesses and households soaring.

“You have all these things coming together, that are going to go counter to the government’s objectives of higher growth and lower inflation,” Mohamed El-Erian, bond market expert and adviser to Allianz, told CNN earlier this week. “And again, the situation wasn’t great to begin with. Now, the problems have been amplified.”

An emergency intervention by the Bank of England on Wednesday calmed markets, and prevented the collapse of some pensions funds. But the Truss plan to boost growth has backfired badly, with investors now expecting that the central bank will have to raise interest rates by 1.25% or even 1.5% by November 2 to tackle its inflationary impact
