Rising imports are a concern but there should not be any curbs on them to check the burgeoning trade deficit, said BVR Subrahmanyam, who retired as commerce secretary on Friday (September 30). He will take charge as chairman & managing director of the India Trade Promotion Organisation (ITPO).

While higher tariffs look like a good short-term solution, in the long run they make industries uncompetitive, he said in an interview to ET.

India's goods exports slowed to 1.62% in August and the trade deficit more than doubled to $27.98 billion from the year-ago period. Imports rose 37.28% to $61.9 billion in August this year.

"Imports are a concern," he said, adding that a lot of imports such as fuel, fertilizer, coking coal, edible oil and pulses are inelastic.

"If you take them out, then 70% of imports are capital, raw material and intermediate products... A lot of manufacturing strength is dependent on imports which is a sign of a healthy economy."

Asked if discussions are on between various ministries to restrict imports, he said: "There are constant talks going on but at the moment I don't think there is any cause for worry. Services are going to bail out the country massively".

To address the trade gap, he said either exports can be increased, or imports can be squeezed through restrictions or tariffs which are useful in the case of gold but add to inflation in other cases.

"The second-order effects of tariff protection in the medium term and long term are not beneficial because industries become uncompetitive. Also, 70% trade happens on global value chains which want free movement of goods," he said.

Despite the restrictions on export of rice, wheat and sugar, he said that India will clock $60 billion of agriculture exports this year as against around $50 billion in FY22.

"It's going to be made up with coffee and marine products," he said.
