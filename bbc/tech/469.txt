We’ve all heard of e-books, but augmented reality might soon be giving us a brand new reading experience.

So-called "augmented books" - or "a-books" - could be coming to shelves near you in the future, with the University of Surrey announcing the latest version of a research project which seeks to combine the best of both physical and electronic books.

Like electronic books, augmented books would allow readers to access extra information or multimedia content about what they are reading; all while keeping the look and feel of a physical book.

For example, a fantasy novel reader could swipe their fingers over a character’s name in their augmented book, and have associated information such as their family tree pop up on their smartphone or another device.

Tourists could open up a physically augmented travel guidebook, and then have up-to-date information such as train times or opening hours flash up on their smartphone or other devices.

"An a-book is something in between an e-book and a traditional book," Dr Radu Sporea, a senior lecturer at the University of Surrey’s Advanced Technology Institute, told Euronews Next.

"We’re familiar with traditional books obviously, and e-books are everywhere. They all have obvious benefits, but they all have downsides. And what we’re trying to do is to reconcile the benefits of both, without bringing the downsides".

At a basic level, the idea is for a user to be able to flick through a physical book, and then have the book know what they are reading and be able to relay that information to a nearby device, such as a TV or a smartphone.

For around five years, Sporea and his colleagues have worked through various iterations of augmented book technology.
