At today's Made by Google event, the tech giant fully revealed its first-ever Pixel Watch.

It's Google's first smartwatch designed and built in-house. It runs on the company's WearOS platform and is compatible with all Pixel and Android phones. It features a curved design, a variety of customizable bands, and full integration with Google apps like Maps and Gmail. 

The Pixel Watch starts at $349 for the WiFi-only model and $399 with LTE, and comes with three months of YouTube premium as well as six months of Fitbit Premium. 

Specifically, that means heart rate measurement, ECG (electrocardiogram) tracking, and sleep monitoring. The Pixel Watch provides regular wellness reports including daily workout readiness scores, health metrics, and sleep scores â€” all designed to help you optimize your workout routine and sleep schedule. 

The Pixel Watch will also include fall detection via software update at some point in 2023.
