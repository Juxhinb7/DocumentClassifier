It doesn't matter if you have the iPhone 13 Mini or the iPhone 13 Pro, Apple's smartphones are glass sandwiches that will shatter when they inevitably escape your hands. That's totally not your fault. But it's why we highly recommend using a case with your expensive iPhone. It's not guaranteed to protect your device, but it can help. We've tested dozens and whittled them down to our favorites below. This list includes other iPhone accessories too, such as cables, charging adapters, and screen protectors.

Updated September 2022: We've added Bluebonnet's MagSafe Wallet and Mophie's 3-in-1 wireless charger. We've also moved many of our MagSafe accessories into their own guide.

A Note on iPhone 13 Cases

We've tested these cases on the iPhone 13 Pro and iPhone 13 Pro Max. Cases that fit the 6.1-inch iPhone 13 will not fit the 6.1-inch iPhone 13 Pro. That's because the camera system on the standard Pro is significantly larger. Some case manufacturers didn't learn of this until the iPhones were announced, so you might see some compatibility issues. It's something to keep an eye on as you shop.
