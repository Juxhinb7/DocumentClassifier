DJI own a major part of the drone market in the US and will be affected by the new developments.

The US Department of Defense has added Shenzhen-based consumer drone maker DJI Technology to a list of firms allegedly connected to the Chinese military.

The Defense Department last year said that systems produced by Da Jiang Innovations (DJI) pose potential threats to national security. The fresh list includes Shenzhen Dn Innovation Technology Co, Ltd. (DII) and BGI Genomics Co Ltd (BGI), China’s largest genomics firm.

The initial list included Huawei Technologies and several other Chinese companies.

In a statement on Wednesday, the Defense Department said that it released the names of Chinese military companies “operating directly or indirectly in the US in accordance with the statutory requirement of Section 1260H of the National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2021".
