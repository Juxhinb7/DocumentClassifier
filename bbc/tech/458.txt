Google has just launched the Pixel 7 series of smartphones globally and while the company was busy talking about the advancements in the technologies that the new phones have, data from International Data Corporation (IDC) suggested that it was an old smartphone from the Pixel lineup that attracted customers the most.

The data from the research analytics firm IDC shows that Pixel 3 is the most-sold Google Pixel phone ever. Google is a "tiny global player" when it comes to selling smartphones. The report also suggests that none of its previous models have ever crossed the 10 million mark in terms of sales. Another interesting data point is that whenever Google launched two models (XL in early variants and Pro starting Pixel 6 series), it is always that smaller phones have sold better.

It is to be noted that Google Pixel 3 series was also the last flagship series by Google that launched in India. The company chose to skip the Pixel 4 flagship model but launched a mid-ranger Pixel 4a. In the consecutive year, Google completely skipped the Pixel 5 series launch in India. However, things seem to have come back to normal as the tech giant brought the premium Pixel 6a earlier this year and also launched the Pixel 7 series.

The Pixel 7 and the Pixel 7 Pro are now up for pre-orders in India and will be available for purchase starting from October 13.

The IDC data was shared by Bloomberg's Vlad Savov, who also tweeted that "since Google launched Pixel phones in 2016, it's sold 27.6 million units. That's 1/10 of Samsung's 2021 sales." That's pretty much comparing Apples to Oranges and we see no comparison here. Samsung launched various smartphones across multiple series, including the M-series, A-series and the flagship S-series. Not to forget the foldable phones â€“ Galaxy Z Fold 4 and Galaxy Z Flip 4.
