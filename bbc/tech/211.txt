For the past couple of weeks, I’ve been carrying one of the new iPhone 14 models with me as my daily driver. When I’ve met up with friends — blissfully unaware of consumer tech goings-on — they’ll ask how work is going, as a matter of etiquette. At that point, my eyes gleam, and I pull the phone out of my tote bag.

“Well,” I say, “I’m testing the new iPhones.” I pause for dramatic effect, and my friend nods politely as I continue.

“It has this new feature called Dynamic Island. Here, let me start a timer and show you...” nodding continues but eyes glaze over at this point.

“And because the sub-pixel array...” At this point in the presentation, my friend is glancing desperately around the room for a convenient out as I explain how it’s meant to feel like a hardware feature.

The reaction when I talk about iOS 16 is very different. My husband got the same iPhone 14 Pro demo — he displayed mild interest — and then I showed him how to copy and paste a photo of our cat just by long-pressing the image. His reaction: “How do I get that?”

My husband and most of my friends aren’t what I would call consumer-tech-savvy, but I think even people with a mild interest in mobile technology would agree: this year’s iPhones are boring, but iOS 16 rules.
