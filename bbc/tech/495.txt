Apple developers wanting to optimise their listing and marketing strategies can now register for the next round of App Store Sessions.

The sessions connect developers with Apple’s experts to learn more about all things App Store, including:

    Improving your listing pages
    Attracting customers
    Testing marketing strategies
    Implementing subscriptions
    Successfully using TestFlight for beta tests

App Store Sessions were first introduced in February to significant interest. They follow the success of Apple’s live Tech Talks; over 100 sessions and workshops that ran from Oct-Dec 2021.

“Discover how to attract new customers, test marketing strategies, add subscriptions, and so much more. Live presentations with Q&A will be held throughout August in multiple time zones and languages,” wrote Apple in a post on its developer website.

The latest round of App Store Sessions will run from 1st August until the week of 29th August. Apple says that more than 75 online sessions will be available globally.

Participants must be members of the Apple Developer Program. If that includes you, head over to Apple’s website here to see the full schedule and register.
