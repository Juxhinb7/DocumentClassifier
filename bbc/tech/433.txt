Samsung’s hi-tech flip phone has been a bit of a hit over the past year. Now the Z Flip is back for 2022, with better cameras, a faster chip, longer battery life and more customisation options than ever, as the company attempts to appeal to those bored of flat phones and looking for something more exciting.

You still have to pay a pretty penny for that cutting-edge appeal. The Galaxy Z Flip 4 costs £999 ($999/A$1,499), which is roughly in line with what you would pay for a premium standard phone, but it is likely to be frequently found at a discount.

Four versions on, the Flip has lost none of its novelty. Opening it to reveal the large 6.7in OLED screen still feels like magic. Its compact pocket size is a welcome relief from massive phones, and its attractive design still very much turns heads. You can even choose a custom colour combo with Samsung’s bespoke studio tool.

A big advance was made last year with water resistance. This year is all about small refinements. The new version is slightly shorter and narrower, with a smaller hinge and thinner bezels around the screen. The sides of the phone are flatter and have a luxurious lustre to them, which with the frosted glass makes the closed Flip 4 a lovely, tactile thing to hold.

It feels like a truly premium piece of consumer electronics, which makes it easy to forget that the folding tech at the centre of the Flip 4 is still very much bleeding edge. You can still see and feel the crease in the middle of the display where it bends but it otherwise feels like a normal glass slab in operation.

It isn’t normal hardened glass, though, and must be treated more carefully than traditional devices. The Flip 4 is not a phone I would recommend ever handing to your kids.
