A flying camera is the latest release from Snap, the company best known for its photo-sharing app Snapchat.

The little yellow drone, called Pixy, is described by the company as a "free-flying sidekick" which can help people take selfies without a selfie stick.

The gadget is available in France and the US, where the laws are more lenient around the use of drones than the UK.

It comes as several social media giants are stepping up their hardware and Augmented Reality (AR) offering.

The Pixy operates on its own, taking video as it flies, which is then wirelessly transferred and saved in the app.

At the end of the flight, the selfie drone lands in the palm of your hand.

Although Snapchat does not receive the same level of attention as other social media networks such as Facebook or Twitter, it remains hugely popular.

Snapchat has 300 million daily active users around the world, according to the company. It also claims to reach more than 75% of those aged 13-34 in more than 20 countries.
