Instagram users will begin to notice a new feature in the coming weeks to help them navigate the delicate terrain of social media etiquette with greater ease.

It’s a mute button. Or, more bluntly, a way to shut up your friends, relatives and acquaintances whose posts you find boring or bothersome, but whom you cannot unfollow without risking a tiff.

Instagram won’t notify anyone that you’ve muted them, and you can still see their profile page if you want to. You’ll also still receive notifications on any posts and comments you’re tagged in on a muted account.
