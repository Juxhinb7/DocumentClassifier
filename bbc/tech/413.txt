Apple unveiled new MacBook Air and 13-inch MacBook Pro models based on its new M2 chip at the company's Worldwide Developers Conference in June. The new MacBook Air is bigger than the previous Air, with the promise of more power. Along with a bigger 13.6-inch display and new M2 chip, however, comes a higher price. Gone is the $999 starting price; the new M2 MacBook Air line starts at $1,199. The updated 13-inch MacBook Pro with the M2 chip starts at the same $1,299 list price as the previous model. 

And now the new M2 machines have received their first discounts. You can save $150 on the M2 MacBook Air and $71 on the M2 MacBook Pro at Amazon.

If you're sad to see the Air's $999 starting price disappear (we are; sniff), you can get the previous-generation MacBook Air with the M1 chip and 13.3-inch display for $850 at Amazon -- a savings of $149. You can also get the previous 13-inch MacBook Pro with the M1 chip for $950 at Best Buy -- that's a substantial $349 discount. 

The 14-inch MacBook Pro and its larger 16-inch Pro sibling, both based on Apple's M1 Pro chip, are the company's biggest and most powerful MacBooks. They are $399 off at Amazon right now and selling for only $1 above the lowest prices we've seen yet.

Some of the discounts offered at Amazon are a combination of a partial discount offered up front with additional savings tacked on at checkout. Pay attention to the green print below the price on the Amazon product page for the added savings at checkout.

With Amazon's Prime Early Access Sale coming soon, and Prime Day-like prices coming with it, we expect the MacBook deals to increase in both frequency and quality so be sure to check out the below list for some of the best prices of the season.
