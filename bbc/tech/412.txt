Here is everything announced at the Made by Google 2022 event:
Everything Pixel 7 and Pixel 7 Pro

The highlight of the event was the Pixel 7 and Pixel 7 Pro phones. The Android flagship phones are extraordinary powerhouses that push the envelope of what Android can do.

    Google’s Pixel 7 and Pixel 7 Pro are coming along, and we took a closer look at what’s new in the flagship Android phones, clocking in at $599 and $899, respectively.
    Hardware Editor Brian got up close and personal with the Google Pixel 7.
    Google Assistant gains a bunch of new smarts, with voice typing, calling and transcription tools.
    Pixel 7 will include a snoring and coughing detection feature, helping users get an early warning for sleep issues.
    The new phones included Guided Frame, a feature that lets blind and visual-impaired folks take selfies with voice guidance.
    A surprise, perhaps, but Google’s Pixel 7 phones will include a VPN solution as part of the OS.
    Last year, Google introduced the Tensor processors in its Pixel phones — and this year’s edition is powered by the second-generation Tensor processor — the G2.

A new smartwatch

    Google’s Pixel Watch costs $350 and represents the company’s first serious foray into the category.
