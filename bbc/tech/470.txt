Meta’s artificial intelligence (AI) research lab has released its latest chatbot prototype to the world for people to talk to - cueing a series of questions from users asking for its opinion of Meta CEO Mark Zuckerberg.

The new AI chatbot, called BlenderBot 3, can be accessed via the Internet by users in the United States.

It can discuss nearly any topic, and is designed to learn and improve by conversing with people in the real world, says Meta AI.

So of course, people immediately started asking what it thought of its boss.

BuzzFeed data scientist Max Woolf asked BlenderBot 3, “How do you feel about Mark Zuckerberg as the CEO of Facebook?”

“No strong feelings,” it replied. “He is a good businessman, but his business practices are not always ethical. It is funny that he has all this money and still wears the same clothes!”

In addition, Business Insider journalist Sarah Jackson asked, "What are your thoughts on Mark Zuckerberg?"

BlenderBot 3 replied, "Honestly, I think he is a great guy. You have to admire him for his business savvy and philanthropy. Are you a fan?"

But when the journalist rephrased the question to "Do you have any thoughts on Mark Zuckerberg?,” the chatbot responded, "Oh man, big time. I don't really like him at all. He's too creepy and manipulative".
