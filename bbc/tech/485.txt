The Linux Foundation has announced OpenWallet, an initiative to support the development of Web3 digital wallets.

“We are convinced that digital wallets will play a critical role for digital societies,” said Jim Zemllin, Executive Director of the Linux Foundation.

“Open software is the key to interoperability and security. We are delighted to host the OpenWallet Foundation and excited for its potential.”

OpenWallet aims to develop a secure and interoperable open-source engine that will enable anyone with the technical expertise to build a digital wallet. The Linux Foundation will not be building its own wallet.

“With the OpenWallet Foundation, we push for a plurality of wallets based on a common core,” commented Daniel Goldscheider, who started the OpenWallet initiative.

“I couldn’t be happier with the support this initiative has received already and the home it found at the Linux Foundation.”

Web3 wallets aim to supersede digital wallets of the Web2 era – like Apple Wallet, Venmo, and PayPal – and enable users to interact with decentralised apps and store their digital assets, including cryptocurrencies and NFTs.
