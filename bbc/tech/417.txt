Nvidia's GeForce RTX 30-series graphics cards are difficult to find on their own, but you can get a prebuilt desktop with one of the new GPUs.

If you aren't up for the challenge of assembling the parts and then building your own gaming rig, a quicker and easier route to a new gaming PC is a prebuilt system. You can find some reasonably priced, off-the-shelf gaming desktops right now with Nvidia's latest GPUs. There are even a few discounts to be found.

PC gamers will find the lowest prices at Best Buy and Newegg right now. After taking a look at the gaming desktops on each site, here are the best deals I've found -- from a desktop discounted to $900 with RTX 3050 graphics to a fully loaded beast with an RTX 3090 GPU.
