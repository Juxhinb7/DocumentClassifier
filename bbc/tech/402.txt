 The Oura ring is a weird wearable.

 It starts at $300 (roughly Â£260 or AU$445).

 It's truly ambient. It's invisible, in a sense. I don't interact with it. It doesn't have a screen.

 In a sense it reminds me of wearables from a decade ago, like the silver-disc Misfit Shine.

 I it doesn't have a screen or readouts for me to study on the fly, but I still wear a smartwatch.

 In that sense, the Oura ring is already redundant. But it manages to do something that the Apple Watch, at least, still doesn't.
