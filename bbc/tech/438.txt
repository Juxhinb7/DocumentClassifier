Two years after the Boston Dynamics dancing robots ad, Tesla brings you...this.

Elon Musk unveiled prototype versions of Tesla's Optimus robot at Tesla's AI Day 2022 event on Friday. They were, well, definitely robots.

At the top of his speech, he offered this disclaimer: "I do want to set some expectations with respect to our Optimus robot. As you know, last year it was just a person in a robot suit. But, we've come a long way, and it's...compared to that, it's going to be very impressive."

And were the things the sixth most valuable company in the world revealed impressive compared to a person in a robot suit? You be the judge!

Over the course of a three-hour event held on a Friday afternoon, Musk and some of his Tesla employees updated the public not just on the robots themselves, but on Tesla's entire robot operation, and its AI development process. As he showed off his stiff, stumbling robots Musk was in a sort of self-deprecating goofball mode, rather than in full blustery visionary mode, offering constant appeals for the audience's good faith and reasonable expectations.

After all, Musk explained, "We just didnâ€™t want it to fall on its face."

The live demonstration featured a wire-laden skeletal Optimus robot that can walk on its own, along with a much less agile, but somewhat less off-putting Optimus with its wires concealed under a streamlined casing. That more streamlined version, however, requires a whole team of people around it to keep it from toppling over. If the content of a video presentation played on a screen during the live demo is to be believed, the wire-laden version can, if tethered to an apparatus attached to the ceiling, water plants with a big, plastic watering can, and move long, slender metal objects around in any sort of context where someone might need a robot to do that type of thing.
