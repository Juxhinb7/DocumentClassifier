Build your STEM skills and train your ear.

Some people are just hard to find gifts for. Whether it’s because their interest is too niche or too technical, shopping can be a struggle. Friends and family of audiophiles and DIY obsessives(opens in a new tab) know how it is. This year, you may be able to give your favorite tech and music enthusiast something they didn’t expect — or directly ask for. Synthia is a DIY digital music sampler that lets you build and code your own synth, complete with its own LED light show, and it has been marked down to $109.99. 

This one gadget combines hardware modification, coding, and music production into one customizable focal point.

Use it as a music sampler that can create any beat and make a mix from five tracks(opens in a new tab). Code your own pocket rave with 121 onboard LEDs, or record your own samples using the built-in MEMS microphone. 

You could also use Synthia as a learning tool. What a cool way to get your young musician thinking of new ways to edit their sound. Or, use it as a teaching tool for a young STEM learner. It could even be an early coding project with tangible results. Mastering a concept in C++ may be satisfying on its own, but how cool would it be to have the reward for all that work on the computer being a programmed LED light show set to your child’s favorite songs?

Whether you’re shopping for an experienced audio enthusiast or a young STEM student (or yourself), Synthia: DIY Digital Music Sampler(opens in a new tab) could be an awesome gift, and it’s on sale for $109.99 (Reg. $119).
